Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discpline that deals with the systematic development of high quality software products using engineering methods,tools and principles.
Software engineering is important because it plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enablingthe creation of reliable,scalable and innovative software solutions that meet the users needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1960s-Development of programming languages and establishment of software engineering as a discpline.
1970s-The advent of structured programming.
2000s-Rise of agile methodologies.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-Gathering and doumenting user needs and system requirements.
Design-Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implemantation-Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing-Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets  quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment-Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance-Providing ongoing support,updates and enhacements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is  a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a wateerfall.
Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focussed on collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software developer is responsible for writing the code and implementing software solutions.
A Quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing plans.
A Project manager oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environment provides tools for writing,debugging and testing codes.Example;Visual Studio
Version Control Systems provide software tools for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating work among team members.Example;Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing reqirements
Tight deadlines
Technical debt
Strategies to overcome this challenges include ;
Effective communiction.
Agile methodologies.
Prioritization of tasks.
Regular reassessment of project goals and timeline.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- Testing individual components or modules of software.
Interaction Testing- Testing interactions between different components.
System Testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to crafting questions or statements to get the best responses from AI models.
This is important because it heelps the AI model give a clear response that the user required.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
VAGUE PROMPT - "How to write a code using JavaScript"
CLEAR PROMPT - "How to write a code that gives the sum of two numbers using JavaScipt and enables the user to key in those two numbers"
